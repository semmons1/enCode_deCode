A binary analysis project in C/C++, made to encode and decode variable information, along with detecting attempts to modify this information.<br>
Really hard to read because C, but good place to start. Microsoft documentation is always quite good: → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/example-c-program-asn1-encoding-and-decoding

Potentially useful five minute read → https://nachtimwald.com/2017/09/24/hex-encode-and-decode-in-c/
